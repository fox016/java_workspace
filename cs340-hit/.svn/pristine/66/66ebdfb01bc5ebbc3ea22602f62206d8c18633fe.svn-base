	Bug 1 Adding a Product to the Storage unit through the Facade causes an error
		Testcase: testAddProductsStorageUnit took 0.006 sec
			Caused an ERROR
		null
		java.lang.NullPointerException
			at model.ProductManager.removeProductFromContainer(ProductManager.java:87)
			at model.FacadeImpl.addProductToContainer(FacadeImpl.java:109)
			at model.TreeTest.testAddProductsStorageUnit(TreeTest.java:168)

	Bug 2 Testing Problems with Singletons
		We have several singltons so the singletons are reused from test case to test case.
		This is undesirable.  I reccomment that for testing purposes, we add a reset() function
		that resets the static instances to their initialial state (by making a new object).
		That way our tests run clean.
